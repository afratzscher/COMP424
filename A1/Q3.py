# Also, you could set a max number of steps in greedy hill climbing before timing out, to help with computational costs. For 100 cities, it's been takign about 100 steps give or take, to reach a local minimum.
# [Wednesday 11:00 PM] Jackie Cheung, Professor
#     Felix Simard, computing the optimal solution is infeasible, but running a local search from a random starting point should be feasible. In my Python implementation, it takes less than a minute to do local search for one instance involving 100 cities. This might depend on your luck in randomly generating TSP instances, but I wouldn't expect one run to take more than 1-2 minutes.

#     If you could figure out if it's a memory issue or a computational efficiency issue, it might help with debugging.
